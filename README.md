# Save the Princess

This is a simple text-based rpg game I made. The objective of the game is to rescue the princess. In order to do so, the player must defeat a series of monsters and collect their loot. The player can only enter a zone if they have the required item found from killing that particular monster. The player can upgrade their weapon and armor using gold found from killing the monsters. The player has 12 days to rescue the princess before she falls in love with the evil warlock Terry. 

This project was mainly an exercise in using pointers, linked lists, inheritance and polymorphism. Enjoy!
